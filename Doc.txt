What:

DrSync does two things:

1.	Synchronizes files on frame activation.

2. 	Saves files on frame deactivation.

---

Why:

*	Switching between DrScheme and your version control client, it is
	easier knowing that your file is saved, and ready for a commit. After
	going through this process only fifty or sixty times, you will to 
	appreciate any way to make it easier.

*	If you use version control keyword expansion, you need to revert your
	file each time you return to DrScheme.

*	If you use an external compilation process, sometimes you forget to
	save your changes, resulting in your quizzical stares and hair pulling.
