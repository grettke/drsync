Announce: DrSync, v1.0.3

Hi folks,

Thanks to great documentation and the fine members of this list,
I've prepared another release of DrSync for DrRacket.

DrSync reverts your files when DrRacket's frame activates and saves them
when it deactivates. 

Something like this would be of particular interest
to folks who run external programs like version control or build
related tools on files which they are editing inside of DrRacket.

What changed? It has been updated for 5.x.

All feedback appreciated.

Best wishes,
