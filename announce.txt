Announce: DrSync, v<ver>

Hi folks,

Thanks to some well written documentation along with the help and
encouragement of the fine members of this mailing list I've prepared
the first release of the DrSync tool for DrScheme.

DrSync is a tool that saves your files on frame deactivation and
reverts them on frame activation. This tool is of particular interest
to folks who run external programs like version control or build
related tools on files which they are editing inside of DrScheme.

Its current version is <ver>. In other words, <release notes>

Now I need everyone's help in finding out if it works on anyone else's
machines AND operating systems.

All feedback appreciated.

Best wishes,
