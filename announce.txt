Announce: DrSync, v1.0.2

Hi folks,

Thanks to some well written documentation along with the help and
encouragement of the fine members of this mailing list I've prepared
another release of DrSync for DrScheme.

DrSync is a tool that saves your files on DrScheme frame deactivation and
reverts them on DrScheme frame activation. This tool is of particular interest
to folks who run external programs like version control or build
related tools on files which they are editing inside of DrScheme.

Its current version is 1.0.2. The big change? It has been updated for 4.x.

All feedback appreciated.

Best wishes,

Grant Rettke
